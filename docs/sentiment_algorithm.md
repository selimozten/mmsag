# Sentiment Analysis Algorithm Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a detailed explanation of the sentiment analysis algorithm used in our Multi-Modal Sentiment Analysis for Crypto Market Prediction project. The algorithm combines natural language processing (NLP) techniques with deep learning to analyze and quantify sentiment in cryptocurrency-related social media posts and news articles.

## Algorithm Components

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into individual words or subwords.
- **Lowercasing**: Converting all text to lowercase for consistency.
- **Special Character Removal**: Eliminating punctuation and special characters.
- **URL and Username Removal**: Stripping out URLs and user mentions.
- **Emoji Translation**: Converting emojis to their textual descriptions.

### 2. Feature Extraction

We use a pre-trained transformer model (BERT) fine-tuned on cryptocurrency-specific data to extract meaningful features from the preprocessed text.

### 3. Sentiment Classification

The sentiment classification is performed using a fine-tuned BERT model with the following architecture:

- BERT base layer (768 hidden units)
- Dropout layer (rate = 0.1)
- Dense layer (64 units, ReLU activation)
- Output layer (3 units, softmax activation)

The model classifies sentiment into three categories: Positive, Neutral, and Negative.

### 4. Sentiment Score Calculation

We calculate a continuous sentiment score between -1 (extremely negative) and 1 (extremely positive) using the following formula:

```
sentiment_score = (positive_prob - negative_prob) * confidence
```

Where:
- `positive_prob` is the probability of positive sentiment
- `negative_prob` is the probability of negative sentiment
- `confidence` is the maximum probability among all three classes

### 5. Temporal Aspects

We incorporate temporal aspects of sentiment by:
- Using exponential decay to give more weight to recent sentiments
- Calculating moving averages of sentiment scores over different time windows

## Model Training and Fine-tuning

1. **Initial Training**: The base BERT model is initially trained on a large corpus of general text data.
2. **Domain Adaptation**: The model is further trained on a large dataset of cryptocurrency-related text to adapt it to the specific language and concepts used in the crypto domain.
3. **Fine-tuning**: The model is fine-tuned on a manually labeled dataset of cryptocurrency-related tweets and Reddit posts to optimize its performance for our specific use case.

## Performance Metrics

We evaluate the model's performance using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- F1 Score
- ROC AUC
- Cohen's Kappa

## Ongoing Improvements

We continuously work on improving the sentiment analysis algorithm by:
- Regularly updating the training data to capture new trends and terminology
- Experimenting with different model architectures and hyperparameters
- Incorporating additional features such as user influence scores and topic modeling
